I have a dedicated browser just for work, and I use Slack solely for work. Any link from Slack, be it a GitHub pull request, an unlisted corporate video on YouTube, or an internal meme, I want to open it in my work-only browser. Everything else I want to open in my default browser. &lt;em>And if I get this to work, Iâ€™ll be awesome&lt;/em>.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Of course, you may argue: but hey, why would you mix your work and personal environments? Thatâ€™s not healthy! Get yourself a different laptop.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Wow, dear, wow! What discipline and work ethics you have. &lt;em>Letâ€™s go. In and out, twenty-minute adventure&lt;/em>.&lt;/p>

Iâ€™ve been very loyal to the ThinkPad brand for more than a decade. Until Lenovo sold me a lemon â€” ThinkPadÂ X13Â AMD. That event encouraged me to reflect on my loyalty. Which I did, and now Iâ€™m happy to share the results.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>How did I reflect? I looked at the ThinkPad evolution under Lenovo by comparing all the models I own: X220, X270 and X13Â AMD (and occasionally a very similar T14s). If there was something I liked in X220 which Lenovo killed in subsequent models, I put it on &lt;em>theÂ bad&lt;/em> list. If there is something that Lenovo kept or even improved in its newer models, I put it on &lt;em>theÂ good&lt;/em> list. By doing so, I was hoping to understand if my loyalty to ThinkPads still has any rational grounds or is mainly driven by habit.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In the end, as a bonus, I will share whatâ€™s so awful about X13Â AMD (and any other AMD-based laptop sold by Lenovo).&lt;/p>

I admit that I had a feeling I was going to bash Lenovo for selling me a terrible product, but nevertheless, I tried to remain calm and rational. Despite my trying, you may find some statements biased and unjustified&lt;/p>&lt;/section></description></item><item><title>Eliminate backlight flicker with Intel i915</title><link>https://127001.me/post/eliminate-backlight-flicker-with-i915/</link><pubDate>Sun, 26 Jul 2020 22:30:00 -0400</pubDate><guid>https://127001.me/post/eliminate-backlight-flicker-with-i915/</guid><description>&lt;aside class="admonition-block note" role="note">&lt;h6 class="block-title label-only">&lt;span class="title-label">Note: &lt;/span>&lt;/h6>&lt;p>This is a revised version of my post from 2013 previously published at

&lt;p>Although still popular, that post was full of factual mistakes.&lt;/p>&lt;/aside>
&lt;p>The brightness of LED backlight in TFT displays is sometimes controlled using a technique called PWM or &lt;em>pulse width
modulation&lt;/em>. If implemented incorrectly, particularly if PWM frequency is too low, it can introduce distracting visual
effects and induce eye strain, headaches, and even dizziness in some
people&lt;a class="footnote-ref" id="_footnoteref_1" href="#_footnote_1" title="View footnote 1" role="doc-noteref">[1]&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Many older laptops set PWM frequency for their backlight too low. Luckily, in laptops equipped with Intel i915 GPU the
PWM frequency is often controlled by the GPU and thus can be adjusted by a software.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>You may be doing FP already</title><link>https://127001.me/post/you-may-be-doing-fp-already/</link><pubDate>Mon, 10 Feb 2020 22:59:08 -0500</pubDate><guid>https://127001.me/post/you-may-be-doing-fp-already/</guid><description>&lt;p>Functional programming (FP) has been a somewhat hot topic in recent years in my surroundings. Although in my &lt;em>close&lt;/em>
surroundings people are usually not zealous or overly excited, I do notice sometimes talks, discussions and vocally
expressed opinions where &lt;em>tremendous&lt;/em> benefits of FP over other paradigms are claimed, through presenting FP as a
fundamentally new approach to writing code, opposite to, say, OOP. Some go as far as saying, that one must fully ditch
OOP and all related experience because itâ€™s all just a mistake.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Such extreme claims are rarely challenged. When a person with an OOP background gets involved in any FP-related
discussion, it quickly gets overwhelmed with new unfamiliar vocabulary: algebras, monads, semigroups, functors, type
classesâ€¦â€‹ And I start questioning intents of those claims â€” are they made to make people shift to FP, or to prove, that
some definition of FP is better than some definition of OOP?&lt;/p>
&lt;p>With this post, I hope to show that FP can be seen as an evolutionary step, a generalization over practices we already
consider the best in OOP paradigm. And if viewed like this, it can be useful even when adopted gradually. I hope this
point of view will persuade programmers to look into FP and to borrow new techniques from it to improve non-FP code.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Filtering ScalaTest tests by tags in sbt</title><link>https://127001.me/post/filter-scalatests-by-tags-in-sbt/</link><pubDate>Mon, 08 Jul 2019 11:00:00 -0400</pubDate><guid>https://127001.me/post/filter-scalatests-by-tags-in-sbt/</guid><description>&lt;p>&lt;em>ScalaTest&lt;/em> lets you tagging your tests with arbitrary tags and then filtering

&lt;p>Most of my technical interviews for Java developer position include a puzzle, where candidate should implement 2 very
similar interfaces in a single class:&lt;/p>
&lt;div class="listing-block">&lt;pre class="rouge highlight" style="background-color: #f8f8f8">&lt;code data-lang="java">&lt;span style="color: #999988;font-style: italic">// Implement both interfaces in a single class if possible&lt;/span>

&lt;p>Iâ€™m not a huge fan of Synology. I bought my DS214 by friendâ€™s recommendation and became frustrated with it right after
the purchase. Bundled software was limited and buggy. Many people find Synology products great. But for me it just
didnâ€™t work well because it forced its use cases on me instead of being a helpful tool for my own very specific use
cases.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Anyway, I wasnâ€™t willing to lose money on reselling my NAS, so I decided to get as much as possible from it and
currently with my DS214Play I can:&lt;/p>
&lt;div class="olist arabic">&lt;ol class="arabic">&lt;li>Play virtually any sound via connected USB sound card.&lt;/li>&lt;li>Particularly, I can play my huge collection of high-resolution music in various formats (with replaygain tags
respected). All that thanks to &lt;em>mpd&lt;/em>, which I can control from any decent phone, web-browser or even smart-watch and
scrobble all statistics to Last.fm.&lt;/li>&lt;li>Stream sound from my laptop via &lt;strong>PulseAudio&lt;/strong>, while watching videos on YouTube or movies.&lt;/li>&lt;/ol>&lt;/div></description></item><item><title>randrctl â€” profile-based screen manager for X</title><link>https://127001.me/post/introducing-randrctl/</link><pubDate>Wed, 17 Sep 2014 18:45:22 +0300</pubDate><guid>https://127001.me/post/introducing-randrctl/</guid><description>&lt;p>While having some free time, decided to automate one of my daily routines â€” setting up external display.&lt;/p>
