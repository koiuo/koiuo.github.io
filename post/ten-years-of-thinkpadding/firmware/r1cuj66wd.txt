  Hereafter the CD/DVD/BD for the UEFI BIOS update is called as "BIOS Update CD".

  The BIOS Update CD can boot the computer disregarding the operating systems
  and update the UEFI BIOS (including system program and Embedded Controller
  program) stored in the Lenovo computer to fix problems, add new functions,
  or expand functions as noted below.

  For that purpose, it is necessary to have the CD/DVD/BD writing software (with
  CD/DVD/BD creation function from the ISO image file) prepared separately.

  Also, any one of the following types of CD-RW, CD-RW & DVD Combo, DVD, DVD
  Multi, BD or other optical drives should be prepared. (Hereafter these drives
  are called as "optical drive".)
  - USB

  This program is language independent and can be used with any language system.
