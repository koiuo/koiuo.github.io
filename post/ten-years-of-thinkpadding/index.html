<article>
<p>Iâ€™m the author of the title picture, and these are my ThinkPads. Iâ€™ve been very loyal to the ThinkPad brand for more than a decade. Until Lenovo sold me a lemon â€” ThinkPadÂ X13Â AMD. That event encouraged me to reflect on my loyalty. Which I did, and now Iâ€™m happy to share the results.</p>
<p>How did I reflect? I looked at the ThinkPad evolution under Lenovo by comparing all the models I own: X220, X270 and X13Â AMD (and occasionally a very similar T14s). If there was something I liked in X220 which Lenovo killed in subsequent models, I put it on <em>theÂ bad</em> list. If there is something that Lenovo kept or even improved in its newer models, I put it on <em>theÂ good</em> list. By doing so, I was hoping to understand if my loyalty to ThinkPads still has any rational grounds or is mainly driven by habit.</p>
<p>In the end, as a bonus, I will share whatâ€™s so awful about X13Â AMD (and any other AMD-based laptop sold by Lenovo).</p>
<section class="admonition-block caution" role=doc-notice><h6 class=block-title><span class=title-label>Caution: </span>Biases ahead ðŸ˜‰</h6><p>When I started working on this post, I did not know where my reflecting would lead me. I admit that I had a feeling I was going to bash Lenovo for selling me a terrible product, but nevertheless, I tried to remain calm and rational. Despite my trying, you may find some statements biased and unjustified</p></section>
<p id=cut>Meet our contestants!</p>

<figcaption>Figure 1. X220, with its lid closed, presents a readable ThinkPad logo to its owner; however, when opened, the people around would see the logo turned upside down. Lenovo has changed this in the following models, and now all the spectators can see a proper ThinkPad logo when the laptop lid is open. Some joke/speculate that this symbolically represents a pivot when Lenovo stopped caring about loyal ThinkPad owners and targeted the mass market instead</figcaption></figure>

<figcaption>Figure 2. View from the side shows how much thinner ThinkPads have become over time</figcaption></figure>
<p>One of the most controversial properties of ThinkPads is probably their design. Some say they look like coffins; others adore their minimalistic brutality and utilitarian aesthetics. Yet, itâ€™s easy to argue that the X220â€™s design from the top picture is the least practical.</p>
<p>Over time, ThinkPads lost their protruding battery, lost several millimeters of their thickness, and got few canted corners here and there. Newer models take less space and are easier to shove into laptop pockets of tightly-packed backpacks.</p>
<p>My aesthetic preference is the squarish design of the X270. It is less practical in terms of packing, but it just looks so much more pleasing to my eye than the X220 or X13Â AMD. I wouldnâ€™t mind their latest models being slightly thicker (with a possibility for an added benefit of improved battery life or a quieter cooling system).</p>
<p>The thinner chassis design leaves less space between the display and the keyboard when a laptop is closed. This may sometimes cause annoying keyboard imprints on the display. X270 (and everything after <em>X230</em>, really) are the worst offenders here: the imprints could even become permanent scratches. While X220 is uncontested, Iâ€™m happy to note that the thinnest of the three laptops I discuss here, the X13Â AMD, shows an improvement over its close predecessors in this regard.</p>
<figure class=image-block><a class=image href=img/imprints.jpg target=_blank rel=noopener><img src=img/s/imprints.jpg alt=imprints></a>
<figcaption>Figure 3. Keyboard and TrackPoint imprints on the display of X270. The blemish from the TrackPoint near the center is actually a scratch, while the rest is just keyboard-shaped dust. The image has been processed for increased contrast</figcaption></figure></section>
<section class="doc-section level-2"><h3 id=_battery_life_and_design><a class=link href=#_battery_life_and_design>Battery life and design</a></h3><div class=table-block><table class="frame-all grid-all stretch"><col style=width:50%><col style=width:50%><tbody><tr><td class="halign-left valign-top">Model</td><td class="halign-left valign-top">Claimed battery life (HH:mm)</td></tr><tr><td class="halign-left valign-top">X220</td><td class="halign-left valign-top">12:39 (9-cell battery)</td></tr><tr><td class="halign-left valign-top">X270</td><td class="halign-left valign-top">13:51</td></tr><tr><td class="halign-left valign-top">T14s</td><td class="halign-left valign-top">14:30</td></tr></tbody></table></div>
<p>All models can last an 8-hour workday of light workload. However, only X270 became my first laptop which could last an entire working day of my <em>typical</em> workload (coding in "heavy" languages and browsing), a considerable step up over X220. With T14s, I donâ€™t even care about battery charge anymore.</p>
<section class="admonition-block important" role=doc-notice><h6 class="block-title label-only"><span class=title-label>Important: </span></h6><p>Being able to throw any typical work at your machine and donâ€™t care about the battery is very liberating. For me, it is the defining trait of an <em>ultra-portable laptop</em></p></section>
<p>Not only the battery life has increased in newer generations, but the design changed such that one can even forget thereâ€™s a battery. X220 had an ugly protruding and heavy 9-cell battery (I used mine with a 6-cell and could only achieve up to 4 hours of my typical workload). X270 had a "hybrid" battery design, consisting of internal and external batteries (both user-replaceable).</p>
<figure class=image-block><a class=image href=img/x270_battery.jpg target=_blank rel=noopener><img src=img/s/x270_battery.jpg alt="x270 battery"></a>
<figcaption>Figure 4. X270 with external battery detached. It can continue working like that powered by its internal battery</figcaption></figure>
<p>T14s only has an internal <em>replaceable</em> battery. While it is harder to replace, it is still possible. On the other hand, ditching the external battery with its housing reduces the laptop size and weight; it means one less moving detachable part, lowering the chance of mechanical breakage.</p>
<aside class="admonition-block note" role=note><h6 class="block-title label-only"><span class=title-label>Note: </span></h6><p>I picked T14s to demonstrate the good point here. X13Â AMD shows quite different results, and Iâ€™ll discuss this later</p></aside></section>
<section class="doc-section level-2"><h3 id=_charging_port><a class=link href=#_charging_port>Charging port</a></h3><p>X220 has a proprietary charging port. X270 offers another version of the proprietary port plus a USB-C with DisplayPort and PowerDelivery support. X13Â AMD can only be charged through its USB-C port.</p>
<figure class=image-block><a class=image href=img/power_supply.jpg target=_blank rel=noopener><img src=img/s/power_supply.jpg alt="power supply"></a>
<figcaption>Figure 5. The charging port evolved to be flatter and smaller to allow for thinner chassis</figcaption></figure>
<p>I can carry a single PowerDelivery charger to charge all my electronics (phone, camera, laptop) when travelling. When in the office, I connect my computer to a display with PowerDelivery support that acts as a USB hub and, effectively, as a docking station.</p></section>
<section class="doc-section level-2"><h3 id=_display><a class=link href=#_display>Display</a></h3><p>I bought my X13Â AMD for photo processing in DarkTable when traveling. This usage scenario shouldâ€™ve been possible thanks to its very decent display.</p>

<p>X13Â AMD has 99% sRGB coverage and can be calibrated for great colors accuracy. However, my 14" T14s comes with 1920Ã—1080 67% sRGB at best, and it is mediocre by todayâ€™s standards.</p></section>
<section class="doc-section level-2"><h3 id=_thinkshutter><a class=link href=#_thinkshutter>ThinkShutter</a></h3><p>ThinkShutter is a fancy name for a camera shutter.</p>
<figure class=image-block><a class=image href=img/camera_shutter.jpg target=_blank rel=noopener><img src=img/s/camera_shutter.jpg alt="camera shutter"></a>
<figcaption>Figure 6. Camera shutters. X270 has a third-party stick-on camera shutter</figcaption></figure>
<p>X13Â AMD has it. Previous models donâ€™t. Itâ€™s not hard to slap a small sticker over the camera hole as I did on my X270, but it looks and feels better if itâ€™s built-in.</p></section>
<section class="doc-section level-2"><h3 id=_sound_system><a class=link href=#_sound_system>Sound system</a></h3><p>X220 has quiet and flat sounding speakers making it the worst possible choice for even watching an occasional YouTube video.</p>
<p>X270 is slightly better.</p>
<p>X13Â AMD has a <em>Dolby Audio</em> speaker system (whatever this means), and it sounds almost unbelievably well for the laptop size.</p></section>
<section class="doc-section level-2"><h3 id=_touchpad><a class=link href=#_touchpad>Touchpad</a></h3><p>Iâ€™m a heavy TrackPoint user, and X220â€™s touchpad feels just right for me. But itâ€™s hard to deny that touchpad users would prefer more recent models. I like that the touchpad size on X13Â AMD is a reasonable compromise: a tad bigger, and the touchpad starts getting in your way, registering clicks when you type and whatnot.</p>
<figure class=image-block><a class=image href=img/touchpads.jpg target=_blank rel=noopener><img src=img/s/touchpads.jpg alt=touchpads></a>
<figcaption>Figure 7. The touchpad became bigger, but it still does not get in your way</figcaption></figure></section>
<section class="doc-section level-2"><h3 id=_trackpoint><a class=link href=#_trackpoint>TrackPoint</a></h3><p>Theyâ€™ve kept it!</p>
<p>Keeping something as it is may not seem such a significant achievement. Still, under marketers' pressure backed by various polls and data (I imagine), Lenovo kept the signature part of the ThinkPad line. And I celebrated this decision of theirs with every model they released over these years.</p></section>
<section class="doc-section level-2"><h3 id=_adequate_hardware_specs><a class=link href=#_adequate_hardware_specs>Adequate hardware specs</a></h3><p>Itâ€™s only natural that newer models offer more modern hardware. Yet Iâ€™m happy that ThinkPads keep offering (usually) the best hardware money can buy at the time of purchase. My X13Â AMD, for example, has a powerful 8-core Ryzen 4750U AMD APU, 32GiB of RAM, and a superfast 1TiB NVMe SSD.</p></section>
<section class="doc-section level-2"><h3 id=_linux_support><a class=link href=#_linux_support>Linux support</a></h3><p>ThinkPad Wi-Fi, webcam, or integrated sound card usually work with little to no effort under Linux. ThinkPads even have their module in the kernel, which gives one access to LEDs and battery charging thresholds from the sysfs. Iâ€™m happy that this remains to be with the newer ThinkPad models.</p></section></section>
<section class="doc-section level-1"><h2 id=_the_bad><a class=link href=#_the_bad>The bad</a></h2><section class="doc-section level-2"><h3 id=_some_hardware_components_could_be_better><a class=link href=#_some_hardware_components_could_be_better>Some hardware components could be better</a></h3><p>Back in the time, X220 offered an IPS display (as an option), and this was a definite advantage over TN displays of most laptops on the market back then.</p>
<p>However, 1920Ã—1080 of their recent 13-inch display model yields a lousy 170 PPI. Itâ€™s enough for me, but it is just an average offering even for 2020 when it was released. Whatâ€™s terrible about this is that Lenovo does not offer better options. And their 14" models yield even lower PPI.</p>
<p>Many people complain about the camera quality, and indeed I havenâ€™t noticed a significant difference between the contestants, and let me remind you, one of them is X220, released more than ten years ago!</p></section>
<section class="doc-section level-2"><h3 id=_productivity_and_ergonomics><a class=link href=#_productivity_and_ergonomics>Productivity and ergonomics</a></h3><p>The attention to tiny details resulting in significant gains in productivity and ergonomics made ThinkPad X220 so special to me and got me hooked in the first place. Itâ€™s like designers were trying to anticipate the struggles of an average ThinkPad user and designed ThinkPads to be helpful in those situations.</p>
<p>Sometimes this resulted in signature properties like TrackPoint (if you didnâ€™t know, TrackPoint lets you control the mouse pointer while keeping your hands in the primary typing position). In other cases, we get nice but often underappreciated features like <em>ThinkLight</em> (a small flashlight built into the top of the lid). These days, when everyone has a phone with a flashlight it doesnâ€™t seem special, but back in the time a built-in <em>desk lamp</em> in the laptop looked fantastic, and was actually helpful (I used it several times on buses and trains).</p>
<p>And sometimes we get just adorable little quirks, like the fact that old 12-inch ThinkPads are sized precisely as a sheet of A4 ISO paper. Just imagine the number of nerve cells saved for office people all over the world (except the US) aligning stacks of documents over their laptops during boring meetings ðŸ˜‰.</p>
<p>But thereâ€™s one feature lost in modern ThinkPads which I miss the most â€” proper palmrest.</p>
<figure class=image-block><a class=image href=img/palmrest.jpg target=_blank rel=noopener><img src=img/s/palmrest.jpg alt=palmrest></a>
<figcaption>Figure 8. Palmrest. Ranging from comfortable to razor-sharp</figcaption></figure>
<p>The palmrest on X220 is long enough to accommodate most hands but short enough not to cause any pressure on oneâ€™s wrists. And the rounded edge of the palmrest makes it not a painful pressure but a relatively gentle support for oneâ€™s palms. Itâ€™s as if X220â€™s palmrest was a <em>resting</em> place for your <em>palms</em>.</p>
<p>On newer laptops (most modern laptops, really), palmrests shouldâ€™ve been named <em>wristknives</em>. Neither they target oneâ€™s palms, they extend way beyond that, nor do they provide a resting place with their razor-sharp edges. Unless Iâ€™m sitting behind a perfectly fitted desk, such "palmrests" often result in thin red pressure marks on my wrists. And if you ever heard words like <em>carpal tunnel</em> or <em>repetitive strain injury</em>, you probably know that any pressure on oneâ€™s wrists, let alone such that creates pressure marks, is extremely unhealthy.</p>
<p>Now, notice a small ledge at the top of the X220 lid. Itâ€™s there not only to fit the rounded palmrest. It also acts as a small sunshade. And although it doesnâ€™t seem like anything significant, it sometimes results in a more comfortable opening angle of the lid in harsh lighting conditions.</p>
<figure class=image-block><a class=image href=img/display_sunshade.jpg target=_blank rel=noopener><img src=img/s/display_sunshade.jpg alt="display sunshade"></a>
<figcaption>Figure 9. A ledge on X220â€™s lid matching its rounded palmrest acts as a small sunshade</figcaption></figure>
<p>To summarize: the original ThinkPad design is full of unique features targeting an average ThinkPad user and helping them get through a typical challenging scenario (f.ex. typing in a dark train with the laptop standing on oneâ€™s lap).</p>
<p>It feels like Lenovo engineers and designers did not understand many of those features. Gradually they dropped many of them (thankfully, TrackPoint remains), turning ThinkPad into yet another most boring and generic laptop that dreams of becoming a MacBook one day.</p></section>
<section class="doc-section level-2"><h3 id=_keyboard><a class=link href=#_keyboard>Keyboard</a></h3><p>The keyboard falls into the last category, but it is so important, that I decided to dedicate a section to it.</p>
<figure class=image-block><a class=image href=img/keyboards.jpg target=_blank rel=noopener><img src=img/s/keyboards.jpg alt=keyboards></a>
<figcaption>Figure 10. An iconic 7-row keyboard of the X220 and a modern 6-row keyboard of its successors</figcaption></figure>
<p>Many spears have been broken on the topic of which one is better. If you happen to have spare 30 minutes, I recommend watching this priceless classic from Mr. Louis Rossmann, where he covers keyboard layout and many other aspects of the ThinkPad redesign. Itâ€™s highly entertaining even if you do not care about ThinkPads.</p>
<p></p><div class=video><iframe src=https://www.youtube.com/embed/doEZMNXz1JY title="YouTube video player" frameborder=0 allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe></div><p></p>
<p>Here are my 2 cents.</p>
<section class="admonition-block important" role=doc-notice><h6 class="block-title label-only"><span class=title-label>Important: </span></h6><p>A good keyboard layout does not force one to withdraw their hands from the primary typing position. At the very least, the layout should not force one to look at the keyboard when either hand is to be moved.</p></section>
<p>Both the new 6-row and the old 7-row keyboards require a typist</p>
<div class=ulist><ul><li>to move their right hand to use the cursor block; and</li><li>to move or stretch the hand to use the Home-End-PgUp-PgDn block.</li></ul></div>
<p>When Iâ€™m using the cursor block on the 6-row keyboard, the only tactile guidance I have is the small bump on the <em>Down</em> key. The cursor keys and the PgUp-PgDn keys are of the same shape and height. So to find the cursor block, my fingers have to glide <em>slowly</em> over the keys along the right edge of the keyboard until I register the small tactile bump, or I reach the bottom edge of the keyboard (meaning, that I glided my fingers to quickly and I missed the bump).</p>
<p>The 7-row keyboard solves this differently: all the keytops on the keyboard <em>except the cursor keys</em> have concave-shaped keytops (meaning, curved inwards), but the cursor keytops are convex (meaning, bumping). And so, the cursor keys are hard to miss even without looking at the keyboard.</p>
<figure class=image-block><a class=image href=img/x220_convex.jpg target=_blank rel=noopener><img src=img/s/x220_convex.jpg alt="x220 convex"></a>
<figcaption>Figure 11. X220 cursor keys have a convex shape, unlike all other keys on the keyboard</figcaption></figure>
<p>The Home/End block of the old 7-row keyboard is also easier to navigate without looking. The 6-row keyboard has a row of featureless F1-F12 keys followed by highly similar Home/End/Insert/Delete. The 7-row keyboard moves the block away from the F1-F12, and it resembles the corresponding block of a classic desktop keyboard layout.</p>
<p>The superior keyboard layout and the palmrest design make X220 a pleasant typing machine. Iâ€™ve never felt an urge to use an external keyboard with it (even though I usually have a <a href=https://happyhackingkb.com/>HHKB</a> on my desk). Here Mr. Rossman has nailed it:</p>
<div class=quote-block><blockquote><p>When I sit down at this laptop to work, and I start working on this keyboard, I donâ€™t feel like "oh, Iâ€™m on a laptop"</p></blockquote></div>
<p>X270 and X13Â AMD are way less comfortable, and I often prefer attaching an external keyboard, even if it means losing any possible advantage from TrackPoint.</p>
<p>To make things worse, look at these two laptops from the same generation:</p>
<figure class=image-block id=x13_t14s_keys><a class=image href=img/x13_t14s_keys.jpg target=_blank rel=noopener><img src=img/s/x13_t14s_keys.jpg alt="x13 t14s keys"></a>
<figcaption>Figure 12. 12/13-inch models have the End and Insert keys combined, while all the larger models donâ€™t have that</figcaption></figure>
<p>No wonder even after more than five years of using the 6-row keyboard almost every day, I still couldnâ€™t get used to it.</p>
<aside class="admonition-block tip" role=doc-tip><h6 class=block-title><span class=title-label>Tip: </span>Backlit vs. non-backlit</h6><p>BTW, look at the difference in the keytops quality on <a href=#x13_t14s_keys>the previous figure</a>. T14s (backlit) looks sleek and premium. X13Â AMD (non-backlit) looks like someone has slapped cheap stickers on top. I havenâ€™t used backlight even once, although I used a few laptops with this technology over long periods. But if I were to buy a new ThinkPad today, Iâ€™d pick the backlit version just for the keytops quality</p></aside></section>
<section class="doc-section level-2"><h3 id=_no_sd_card_slot><a class=link href=#_no_sd_card_slot>No SD card slot</a></h3><p>Starting from X280, ThinkPads no longer offer an SD card slot.</p>
<figure class=image-block><a class=image href=img/sd_card.jpg target=_blank rel=noopener><img src=img/s/sd_card.jpg alt="sd card"></a>
<figcaption>Figure 13. The latest ThinkPad models only have a MicroSD card reader</figcaption></figure>
<p>It gets more ironic when you consider that Apple, a company known for its love for proprietary ports and overpriced dongles, as of now offers <em>14" MacBook Pro</em> with an SD card slot! But the latest ThinkPad, usually known for its extensibility and friendliness towards tinkerers, developers, and all sorts of enthusiasts, doesnâ€™t have that!</p>
<p>Ok, maybe Lenovo decided to target numerous drone owners instead. They sure tried their best to make the slot unusable even for them if they did.</p>
<p>First, Lenovo placed the slot on the back of the laptop. The only worse place for it probably would be a bottom cover.</p>
<p>Second, it requires a pin to open it. Remember the outrage when Apple first introduced this in their iPhones? Lenovo brought this hated design decision into the ThinkPad line a decade later.</p>
<p>The last and the most ridiculous: the slot is not accessible while the laptop lid is open! Technically, one has to half-shut the lid, but the hinges give up in this position, and the lid flops down.</p>

The tale of X13Â AMD</a></h2><p>In the <a href=#_battery_life_and_design>Battery life and design</a> section, I substituted the X13Â AMD with the Intel-based T14s because the X13Â AMDâ€™s battery performance is awful. I could not find anywhere what battery life Lenovo promises on a single charge; in my experience, it barely survives 6 hours.</p>
<p>But the biggest issue with the X13Â AMD is not its battery life when the laptop performs any work, but its battery life when it sleeps!</p>
<p>Soon after receiving my X13Â AMD I noticed some issues: I often would take out my X13Â AMD from my backpack to only find it completely discharged. Since I had long lost the habit of tracking the battery charge, I explained this by forgetting to charge the machine. Sometimes upon pulling the laptop from the tight backpack pocket, I would notice that the bag is slightly warm. Sometimes the computer would be straight powered on, other times it would be sleeping, but somewhat warm anyway. Then I noticed that sometimes the laptop would wake up immediately after going into suspend. There were other minor annoyances, like the key '4' <em>"sticking"</em> (not physically) and producing a long stream of <em>4444444444444444444</em><a class=footnote-ref id=_footnoteref_2 href=#_footnote_2 title="View footnote 2" role=doc-noteref>[2]</a>.</p>
<p>The only real issue to me was unreliable suspend. I assumed it was caused by poor Linux support. And since I was busy at the time, I decided to postpone the troubleshooting and get back to using my other laptops. If I knew what I know now, I wouldâ€™ve returned the computer and requested a refund.</p>
<section class="doc-section level-2"><h3 id=_spontaneous_wake_ups_fixed><a class=link href=#_spontaneous_wake_ups_fixed>Spontaneous wake-ups (fixed)</a></h3><p>When I started troubleshooting the suspend issue, I stumbled on the firmware update from Lenovo</p>

<p><em>S0ix</em> was most recently introduced by Intel and offered lower latency when transitioning back to <em>S0</em>. But its energy consumption is slightly higher than of <em>S3</em><a class=footnote-ref id=_footnoteref_4 href=#_footnote_4 title="View footnote 4" role=doc-noteref>[4]</a>.</p>
<p>Another essential difference between the two is that in <em>S3</em>, the OS kernel dumps its state and passes the control to the firmware (BIOS), and in <em>S0ix</em>, the OS kernel keeps managing all power-related functions even when the system is "asleep". <em>S0ix</em> requires support from the OS kernel, and it sometimes may be missing some combination of kernels and platforms.</p>
<p>In Lenovo firmware, there is an option <code>Sleep state</code> with the choice of 2 values <code>WindowsÂ 10</code> and <code>Linux</code>.</p>
<p>However, both values have no direct relation to either Windows 10 (or any other version for that matter) or Linux but represent <em>S0ix</em> and <em>S3</em> correspondingly.</p></aside>
<p>So the issue was caused by a bug in Lenovo firmware.</p></section>
<section class="doc-section level-2"><h3 id=_battery_drain_in_s3_ongoing><a class=link href=#_battery_drain_in_s3_ongoing>Battery drain in S3 (ongoing)</a></h3><p>Later I discovered that sporadic wake-ups were not the only issue.

<p>Soon enough, a Lenovo representative <a href=https://forums.lenovo.com/user/viewprofilepage/user-id/1942528>MarkRHPearson</a> joined the thread and reassured us that the team was looking into the issue.</p>
<div class=image-block><a class=image href=https://forums.lenovo.com/topic/findpost/27/5037674/5179283 target=_blank rel=noopener><img src=forum/01_we_are_working_on_it.png alt="01 we are working on it" width=500></a></div>
<p>Later he posted the energy consumption stats which Lenovo team has received from some third-party certification entity</p>
<div class=image-block><a class=image href=https://forums.lenovo.com/topic/findpost/27/5037674/5191101 target=_blank rel=noopener><img src=forum/02_official_stats.png alt="02 official stats" width=500></a></div>
<p>Hereâ€™s the data from the screenshot</p>
<div class=table-block><table class="frame-all grid-all stretch"><col style=width:50%><col style=width:50%><tbody><tr><td class="halign-left valign-top">State</td><td class="halign-left valign-top">Consumption</td></tr><tr><td class="halign-left valign-top">short idle</td><td class="halign-left valign-top">6.85</td></tr><tr><td class="halign-left valign-top">long idle</td><td class="halign-left valign-top">4.76</td></tr><tr><td class="halign-left valign-top">sleep/suspend (S3)</td><td class="halign-left valign-top">1.43</td></tr><tr><td class="halign-left valign-top">off</td><td class="halign-left valign-top">0.56</td></tr></tbody></table></div>
<p>I can only assume the numbers are in Watts, this would match my observations.</p>
<p>Letâ€™s do some back-of-the-napkin calculations. The T14Â AMD comes with a 57Wh battery. With the discharge rate of 1.43W in <em>S3</em>, the laptop would survive for <code>57 / 1.43 = 39.86</code> hours.</p>
<section class="admonition-block important" role=doc-notice><h6 class="block-title label-only"><span class=title-label>Important: </span></h6><p>According to the stats posted by a Lenovo representative, it takes T14Â AMD only 39.86 hours to eat through its new fully charged 57Wh battery while sleepingÂ (<em>S3</em>)</p></section>
<p>My observations show that the X13Â AMD is slightly better in that regard and would last up to 50 hours from a single charge of its 48Wh battery, which yields ~0.96W consumption.</p>
<p>Imagine finishing up your work on Friday evening, closing your laptop, and throwing it onto a coffee table. Then opening it on Sunday evening, fully discharged. In a decade of ThinkPadding, Iâ€™ve never encountered anything like this. For comparison, I can suspend my T14s with its battery half depleted, leave for vacation for a week, upon return, wake it up, read all the e-mails accumulated while I was away, and only after that receive an alert about critical battery level<a class=footnote-ref id=_footnoteref_5 href=#_footnote_5 title="View footnote 5" role=doc-noteref>[5]</a>.</p>
<p>Lenovo <strong>had</strong> the energy consumption numbers at some point. A trivial arithmetic operation would lead them to a conclusion, that their products have issues. It seems very unlikely, that no one in the company has noticed there are issues.</p>
<aside class="admonition-block tip" role=doc-tip><h6 class="block-title label-only"><span class=title-label>Tip: </span></h6><p>Intel started pushing <em>S0ix</em> onto customers, and Microsoft and many laptop vendors now happily support that initiative. Laptop vendors hide or altogether remove <em>S3</em> support from the firmware, and Microsoft makes <em>S0ix</em> default in Windows even if the firmware advertises both <em>S0ix</em> and <em>S3</em>. Linux users are not the only victims here because <em>S0ix</em>, as <a href=#ACPI_PS>previously discussed</a>, has higher energy consumption, regardless of the installed OS.</p>
<p>Below I collected some competitors to Lenovoâ€™s AMD-based ThinkPads. To my surprise, none of those laptops support <em>S3</em>, which actually makes Lenovo offering to stand out, even though their <em>S3</em> implementation has serious yet unresolved issues</p>

<section class="doc-section level-2"><h3 id=_battery_drain_in_s5_fixed><a class=link href=#_battery_drain_in_s5_fixed>Battery drain in S5 (fixed)</a></h3><p>With the promises from <a href=https://forums.lenovo.com/user/viewprofilepage/user-id/1942528>MarkRHPearson</a> that the team is looking into the battery drain issue, I started regularly checking the Lenovo website for firmware updates, trying new versions as soon as they come out. And one of such updates delivered entirely unexpected results.</p>
<p>Firmware 1.30 has increased energy consumption in <em>S5</em> (power-off) nearly to the levels of <em>S3</em>, which was already ridiculously high. This effectively meant that no matter what you do: close the lid, save your work and power off â€” you will find your laptop fully discharged after just a weekend unless you connect it to the charger.</p>
<p>And despite</p>
<div class="olist arabic"><ol class=arabic><li>all the previous firmware versions being not susceptible to the issue of battery drain in <em>S5</em>, and</li><li><em>S5</em> being a power state, in which the hardware that can run an operating system is supposed to be fully powered-off,</li></ol></div>
<p>Lenovo believed and tried to convince everyone else that the their laptops' root cause for eating through a fully charged battery in just two days <strong>while powered-off</strong> isâ€¦â€‹ the Linux kernel.</p>

<pre>UPDATING THE UEFI BIOS

Notes:

- In case user update the UEFI BIOS v1.32 (R1CET63W) from update CD, need to

  1).Please press F1 key to BIOS setup.
  2).Press the F9 key to load default configuration.
  3).Select Yes.
  4).Press F10 key to save default configuration and exit.
  5).Select Yes.

<p>Ask yourself and answer in all honesty</p>
<div class="olist arabic"><ol class=arabic><li>would you read about the update procedure after youâ€™ve done multiple BIOS updates for the same machine already?

<p>Apparently, unless users reset their BIOS to factory defaults, flashing the firmware 1.32 would permanently brick their devices<a class=footnote-ref id=_footnoteref_6 href=#_footnote_6 title="View footnote 6" role=doc-noteref>[6]</a>. And thatâ€™s what happened to many, including me.</p>
<p>I understand, how easy it may be to shift the blame onto the user here. Iâ€™m a software engineer myself, and I hate it, when my customers donâ€™t read the documentation (although if thereâ€™s anything as critical as a risk of permanently bricking a 2000$ worth of equipment, I go out of my way to stress this to the customers). But Lenovo probably did not even anticipate the risk of bricking customers' devices.</p>
<div class=image-block><a class=image href=https://forums.lenovo.com/topic/findpost/27/5037674/5336902 target=_blank rel=noopener><img src=forum/05_firmware_team_aware.png alt="05 firmware team aware" width=500></a></div>
<p>I see this as negligence, which likely cost someone a motherboard replacement.</p>
<p>Luckily for me, my Laptop was still under Lenovoâ€™s international warranty. Unluckily, I was in Ukraine when this happened, so it took more than a month to replace the motherboard. The service also wiped my encrypted SSD (despite my having Lenovoâ€™s Keep-Your-Drive warranty) and branded it as new (standard Lenovo service procedure requires installing a new SSD). But I understandingly consider this an issue of Lenovoâ€™s service partner in Ukraine.</p></section></section>
<section class="doc-section level-1"><h2 id=_conclusion><a class=link href=#_conclusion>Conclusion</a></h2><p>I thought it through: the two things I liked about ThinkPads the most are their unique ergonomics and the <em>above-average</em> Linux support.</p>
<p>Most of the ThinkPads' unique features, as Iâ€™ve realized upon writing this article, are long gone. The only remaining part of the legendary ThinkPad ergonomics is its TrackPoint. At the same time, the combination of mediocre keyboard layout and just average palmrest make ThinkPads less suitable for comfortable typing sessions anyway, somewhat reducing the real TrackPoint advantage to mere sentiment.</p>
<p>The removal of the SD cards slot and Ethernet port has made recent ThinkPads a suboptimal choice for traveling photographers and some IT professionals.</p>
<p>The Linux support is still slightly above average, although the average, thanks to the overall progress and companies like <a href=https://frame.work>Framework computer</a> and <a href=https://system76.com>System76</a> have increased. But there are still plenty of vendors out there who continue making questionable technical decisions hurting Linux support.</p>
<p>Lenovo still has an edge with their international warranty, although after my experience, Iâ€™m hesitant in relying too much on it. And Lenovoâ€™s indifference to customers satisfaction (as demonstrated by my experience with X13Â AMD) is straight frustrating.</p>
<p>Despite my holding a grudge, I conclude that Lenovo ThinkPads are still a decent choice today. However, due to their losing their unique character ThinkPads are no longer uncontested: few companies out there offer similar specs packed in a slightly more generic design, but with a better Linux support as a trade-off. Advancements in the industry combined with some regressions in the ThinkPad evolution under Lenovo may easily swing my decision in favor of some other vendor when my next laptop is due.</p></section>
