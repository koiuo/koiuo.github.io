&lt;p>In this post I’ll describe how to set up PulseAudio in Debian chroot, so that it’s possible to stream any sound from
linux-powered pc to a sound card connected to Synology NAS.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Turning Synology NAS into a geeky media server</title><link>https://127001.me/post/synology/mediaserver-p1/</link><pubDate>Wed, 06 Jan 2016 01:51:40 +0100</pubDate><guid>https://127001.me/post/synology/mediaserver-p1/</guid><description>&lt;section class="admonition-block warning" role="doc-notice">&lt;h6 class="block-title label-only">&lt;span class="title-label">Warning: &lt;/span>&lt;/h6>&lt;p>This post was written in pre-docker era.

&lt;p>I’m not a huge fan of Synology. I bought my DS214 by friend’s recommendation and became frustrated with it right after
the purchase. Bundled software was limited and buggy. Many people find Synology products great. But for me it just
didn’t work well because it forced its use cases on me instead of being a helpful tool for my own very specific use
cases.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Anyway, I wasn’t willing to lose money on reselling my NAS, so I decided to get as much as possible from it and
currently with my DS214Play I can:&lt;/p>
&lt;div class="olist arabic">&lt;ol class="arabic">&lt;li>Play virtually any sound via connected USB sound card.&lt;/li>&lt;li>Particularly, I can play my huge collection of high-resolution music in various formats (with replaygain tags
respected). All that thanks to &lt;em>mpd&lt;/em>, which I can control from any decent phone, web-browser or even smart-watch and
scrobble all statistics to Last.fm.&lt;/li>&lt;li>Stream sound from my laptop via &lt;strong>PulseAudio&lt;/strong>, while watching videos on YouTube or movies.&lt;/li>&lt;/ol>&lt;/div></description></item></channel></rss>
