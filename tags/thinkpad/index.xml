Iâ€™ve been very loyal to the ThinkPad brand for more than a decade. Until Lenovo sold me a lemon â€” ThinkPadÂ X13Â AMD. That event encouraged me to reflect on my loyalty. Which I did, and now Iâ€™m happy to share the results.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>How did I reflect? I looked at the ThinkPad evolution under Lenovo by comparing all the models I own: X220, X270 and X13Â AMD (and occasionally a very similar T14s). If there was something I liked in X220 which Lenovo killed in subsequent models, I put it on &lt;em>theÂ bad&lt;/em> list. If there is something that Lenovo kept or even improved in its newer models, I put it on &lt;em>theÂ good&lt;/em> list. By doing so, I was hoping to understand if my loyalty to ThinkPads still has any rational grounds or is mainly driven by habit.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In the end, as a bonus, I will share whatâ€™s so awful about X13Â AMD (and any other AMD-based laptop sold by Lenovo).&lt;/p>
&lt;section class="admonition-block caution" role="doc-notice">&lt;h6 class="block-title">&lt;span class="title-label">Caution: &lt;/span>Biases ahead ðŸ˜‰&lt;/h6>&lt;p>When I started working on this post, I did not know where my reflecting would lead me. I admit that I had a feeling I was going to bash Lenovo for selling me a terrible product, but nevertheless, I tried to remain calm and rational. Despite my trying, you may find some statements biased and unjustified&lt;/p>&lt;/section></description></item></channel></rss>
